# 🔧 8-Bit CMOS-Based Pipelined ALU
## ⚙️ Features
### 🧠 CMOS Logic Implementation

This project implements an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using custom CMOS logic gates and Verilog HDL, structured with a 4-stage pipelined architecture and a dual-phase clock system.

It is designed for hardware enthusiasts and VLSI learners, providing hands-on experience in digital logic design and transistor-level circuit implementation.

The ALU supports fundamental arithmetic and logical operations while maintaining modularity, pipeline efficiency, and carry/borrow flag tracking.
