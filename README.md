# üíæ Verilog Synchronous FIFO (8x32)

This project is a complete RTL implementation of a parameter-driven, synchronous FIFO (First-In, First-Out) memory buffer in Verilog.  
A FIFO is a fundamental building block in digital design, essential for handling data flow between modules operating at different speeds or with bursty data.

This repository includes both the synthesizable RTL design and a robust, self-checking testbench to verify its functionality under various conditions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Features

- üìè **Parameterized Design:** Easily change `fifo_width` (default: 32) and `fifo_depth` (default: 8) in the design.  
- üö© **Status Flags:** Provides reliable `full` and `empty` output signals.  
- üß† **Smart Pointers:** Uses the standard "extra bit" pointer comparison method for robust full/empty detection.  
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Fully Synchronous:** All read and write operations are synchronized to a single clock (`clk`).  
- üîÑ **Asynchronous Reset:** Includes an active-low reset (`rst_n`) to initialize the FIFO to its empty state.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Simulation

This project can be compiled and run from any standard terminal using **Icarus Verilog**.

```bash
# 1. Compile the design and testbench
#    (We must include the rtl/ and tb/ paths)
iverilog -o result rtl/sync_fifo_8x32.v tb/sync_fifo_8x32_tb.v

# 2. Run the compiled simulation
vvp result

# 3. View the generated waveform

üìà Verification & Waveform

The self-checking testbench (sync_fifo_8x32_tb.v) automatically verifies the FIFO's behavior by running through three key scenarios:

Full Test: Writes to the FIFO until the full flag asserts, then attempts one more "overflow" write (which should be ignored).

Empty Test: Reads from the FIFO until the empty flag asserts, then attempts one more "underflow" read (which should be ignored).

Simultaneous R/W Test: Runs a loop of simultaneous reads and writes to test data integrity.
